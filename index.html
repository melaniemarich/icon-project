    <!--INTRO-->
    <p>
      The National Labor Relations Board recently reversed a 52-year-old ruling on how to form a union, making it easier for employees to form a union by eliminating a step that allows employers to set aside union elections. The ruling reinstates the “Joy Silk doctrine,” which stated that workers who got a majority of their coworkers to sign union cards would not have to prove the majority again in an NLRB election, and instead they could simply tell their employer about the newly formed union, demand legal recognition and begin negotiations.

        This ruling came out last month at the end of what many people have called "Hot Labor Summer", where many prominent unions have gone on strike and many workplaces have begun the unionization process, including the Writers Guild of America, SAG-AFTRA, and most recently United Auto Workers.

        The new ruling puts the onus on employers to either recognize the union voluntarily or file with the NLRB for an official union election. Here are the steps a workplace unionizing will have to take now.

    <h4 class="icon-header">Step 1: Get a majority of coworkers to sign a union card. </h4>
      <p class="icon-text"> In order for a union to be designated, a majority of the workers must sign a union card. Before the reinstatement of the Joy Silk doctrine, this would only be the first step to starting a union, as a union election could only happen if a majority of the union cards were signed. Now, signing the union cards and having a majority is enough to be deemed a union by the NLRB.

<h4 class="icon-header"> Step 2: Inform employer of the newly formed union and request legal recognition. </h4>
    <p>  By the standards set by the new ruling, employees do not need to conduct a secret ballot election before becoming a union. The onus is on the employer to call for a board-certified election if they mistrust the notion that a majority of their employees have signed union cards.

      <h4 class="icon-header"> Step 3: If the employer recognizes the union, begin negotiations immediately. </h4>
    <p> It is important to note that although this ruling removes a hurdle to forming a union, there are no legal ramifications for employers if they stall bargaining. The NLRB requests that employers begin good-faith negotiations immediately after recognizing the union, but the ruling does not indicate any consequences for employers if they do not. These issues are likely to be dealt with in future rulings by the NLRB, should the current board be reinstated.</p>

    <h4 class="icon-header">  Step 3 Alternative: if the employer does NOT recognize the union, the EMPLOYER must contact the NLRB. </h4>
    <p>  If an employer calls for a board-certified election, they MUST do so within two weeks or be forced by the NLRB to bargain with the union. This differs from the previous labor rulings, which put the onus on employees to demand a board-certified election and allowed employers to simply ignore the unionization and the bargaining demand. This also differs from the original Joy Silk doctrine of 1969, which did not have a recourse for employers to challenge the union designation.</p>
